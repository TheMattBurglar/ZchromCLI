This is a CLI program to test what would happen if we added a Z chromosome to the population that made a person Female, regardless of their other chromosome. ex: a ZY Female

This is a somewhat updated version that uses flags to alter standard values so you can more easily pipe the output to a file or setup your own GUI, or whatever else you want to do. I did use AI to help me with the flag parsing, but I did the rest myself.  If the original AI-free version interests you, you can find it here: https://github.com/TheMattBurglar/Zchrom

Flags:

`yeggs`: Viable Y Chromosome Eggs? (Y/N)

`popAdam`: Initial Adam Population

`maxPop`: Max Population
